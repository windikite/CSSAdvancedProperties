My 30th assignment! The requirements for this project is as follows:  

Assignment 1  
1. Create a class named background-fade, apply it, and use RGBA to set a semi-transparent color as the background color. I did this to create the darkening effect over the striped background.  

2. Add an H1 and give it a text shadow using RGBA. The H! does have a blue and black text shadow.  

3. Create a button with a solid RGBA background color and change it when hovered over. Mine loses opacity and becomes blue.  

Assignment 2:  
1. Create a transition for all hyperlinks so they smoothly change color when hovered over. This is implemented for the 3 links at the bottom.  

2. Animate the button on click so that it increases in size. The log in button changes size to pulse in response to a click.  

3. Add a rotating icon on the page. I added the laughing man from ghost in the shell.  

I'm very happy with how this turned out, and will likely be using something similar for my portfolio in some way.
